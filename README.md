# Geometry of Horospheres in Hyperbolic Groups

This project aims to understand and visualize horospheres in hyperbolic right-angled Coxeter groups. Using tools such as finite state machines and fiber products we are able to efficiently generate pieces of the horospheres of right-angled Coxeter Groups. The quick computation allows us to visualize the geometry in a manner not allowed for before. This gives us insight into the boundaries of such groups.
